# Description

This solver solves the ideal Euler equations in 1 dimension using the Van Leer
(VL) algorithm. It includes support for multiple types of initial conditions and
boundary conditions. See the documentation for
Simulation1D::_setInitialConditions and Grid1D::updateBoundaries respectively
for details.
